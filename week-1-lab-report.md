## How to Log Into a Course-Specific Account on ieng6!

  ### 1. Reset Password

      * Use this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) to reset your password
      * Input your Username and Student ID in the Account Lookup section and click submit
      * Afterwards, click on the button under additional accounts. It should look like this:
      
      ![accountName](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122576334/212242991-d354665c-0b86-40bc-8dd2-2abcfe002fc3.png)
      * Then, click "change your password" to reset your password

  ### 2. Download VSCode (skip if you already have VSCode installed!) 

      * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
      * Follow the directions the setup gives to install VSCode
      * It should look something like this after opening VSCode:
      ![vscode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122576334/212242961-5e9e3bc5-ee08-4d62-87ac-6d8b608d7308.png)
      
  ### 3. Downloading Git for Windows (skip if you're a MacBook user!)

      * Download [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
      * After finishing installing, open VSCode, press Ctrl + Shift + P, and type 'Select Default Profile'
      * Click on 'Git Bash' as seen below (if it doesn't show up, close and reopen VSCode and do the same thing)
      ![gitBash](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122576334/212242927-f71c2348-7b87-4b6e-9b9c-f310260f27a9.png)
      
  ### 4. Opening the bash terminal

      * At the top of VSCode, click 'Terminal' then 'New Terminal'
      * In the top right corner of the terminal, click on the drop down arrow next to the + sign and click on 'bash' or 'Git Bash' (mainly for MacBook users but do the same if you have a different type of terminal open)
      
      ![bashTerminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122576334/212242843-55c04320-37f0-493a-9358-b0880e81e039.png)
      * If you have more than one terminal open, make sure you have bash selected

  ### 5. Connecting to ieng6

      * In the terminal, input 'ssh (username)@ieng6.ucsd.edu' then click enter. The input should look like this (red is to blur my letters/numbers):
      
      ![username](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122576334/212242788-5f33f475-d931-49ed-90ae-a138d67769cf.png)
      * The output should look like this:
      
      ![output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122576334/212242750-687eeb6f-acdf-4bc8-b655-b2df8f99cdf1.png)
      * Type yes into the terminal then press enter
      * Finally, the terminal asks for a password so you enter the password that you reset/changed to in Step 1 then press enter (password will not show up)
      * The output should look something like this:
      
      ![output2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122576334/212242627-ff9023ee-73a2-461e-a733-19b6788d6182.png)
      
  ### 6. Trying some Commands!

      * Some commands that I tried!:
      ![commands](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122576334/212242566-72f801a3-7184-4bf6-ab74-11702a9bf395.png)

    
      
  And that's how you connect to the ieng6 server!
