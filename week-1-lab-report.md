# **Week 1 Lab Report**
## How to Log Into a Course-Specific Account on ieng6!

  1. Reset Password

      * Use this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) to reset your password
      * Input your Username and Student ID in the Account Lookup section and click submit
      * Afterwards, click on the button under additional accounts. It should look like this:
      
      ![accountName](https://github.com/skn0012/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/e8f10820caa12ccf8b93c0ad66feebc23ffeded3/15lss1.PNG)
      * Then, click "change your password" to reset your password

  2. Download VSCode (skip if you already have VSCode installed!) 

      * https://code.visualstudio.com/download
      * Follow the directions the setup gives to install VSCode
      * It should look something like this after opening VSCode:
      ![vscode](https://github.com/skn0012/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/5c7d7341a8aff76fc47eb5ce0dbf6c95720d1ab8/15lss2.PNG)
      
  3. Downloading Git for Windows (skip if you're a MacBook user!)

      * Download [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
      * After finishing installing, open VSCode, press Ctrl + Shift + P, and type 'Select Default Profile'
      * Click on 'Git Bash' as seen below (if it doesn't show up, close and reopen VSCode and do the same thing)
      ![GitBash](https://github.com/skn0012/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/757238b524185e5fbfba27062f089dbd6df4f985/15lss3.PNG)
      
  4. Opening the bash terminal

      * At the top of VSCode, click 'Terminal' then 'New Terminal'
      * In the top right corner of the terminal, click on the drop down arrow next to the + sign and click on 'bash' or 'Git Bash' (mainly for MacBook users but do the same if you have a different type of terminal open)
      
      ![bashTerminal](https://github.com/skn0012/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/e8cf647b680d8f3f6f442a15c870f776ba903971/15lss4.PNG)
      * If you have more than one terminal open, make sure you have bash selected

  5. Connecting to ieng6

      * In the terminal, input 'ssh (username)@ieng6.ucsd.edu' then click enter. The input should look like this:
      
      ![username](https://github.com/skn0012/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/d87a7401f17b97b806b314bbd6fc27e69239de6f/15lss5.PNG)
      * The output should look like this:
      
      ![output](https://github.com/skn0012/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/6ddcb241ad9ec35cf2bc32c701c490fcdcd34199/15lss6.PNG)
      * Type yes into the terminal then press enter
      * Afterwards, the terminal asks for a password so you enter the password that you reset/changed to in Step 1 then press enter (password will not show up)
      * The output should look something like this:
      
      ![output2](https://github.com/skn0012/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/e76d04c8f7ef15a971f980f10a044634be00ce69/15lss7.PNG)
      
  Done!
