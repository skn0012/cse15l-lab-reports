# **Week 7 Lab Report - Skyler Nguyen**

## Challenge Task

## Setup

1. I logged into the ieng6 server by doing *ssh cs15lwi23aiz@ieng6.ucsd.edu*. (No password since I setted it up so that I didn't have to input a password to log in)
2. Typed *ls* into the terminal and checked if lab7 was in the ieng6 directory.
3. If lab7 was in the directory:
   1. Typed *rm -r lab7* into the terminal and pressed enter.
   2. Four questions popped up (one after the other), for each one, typed *yes* into the terminal and pressed enter. It looked like this:
