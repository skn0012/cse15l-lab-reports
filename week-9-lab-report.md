# **Week 9 Lab Report - Skyler Nguyen**

## Redoing Researching Commands (Lab Report 3)

* This time I did the command *find*.

## 1. **find -name "filename"**

* This searches for the specific file name that the user inputs in the current directory and its subdirectories. It's useful for searching a whole directory for a single file by name.

```
find -name "Bahamas-History.txt"

./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt
```

```
find -name "ch1.txt"

./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt
./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/ch1.txt
./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch1.txt
./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch1.txt
./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch1.txt
```
